### A/B Testing (Comparing Two Independent Population Proportions)

In Survey Methodology (Dec. 2013), factors that influence survey reponse rates were investigated. A designed experiment allowed Web users to interact with two different versions of surveys. One format used a welcome screen with a white background and the other used a welcome screen with a red background. The break-off-rates (the porportion of sampled users who quit the survey before completing it) was recorded for both formats. We will use a two sample test of hypothesis about (p1 - p2) to find if the true break-off-rate is lower for the format with the red welcome screen than the format with the white welcome screen. 

|       | White Welcome Screen          | Red Welcome Screen |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Number of Web users     | 190| 183 |
| Number who break off survey     | 49      |   37 |
| Break-off rate |.258 | .202


### Conditions Required for Vaid Large-Sample Inferences about (p1 - p2)
1. The two samples are randomly selected in an independent manner from the two populations.
2. The sample sizes, n1 and n2, are large
